I’m Avinash, who enjoys developing software, whether that be websites, applications, or anything in between.

After my undergrad college degree in _"Computer Science and Engineering"_, to further my knowledge I decided to pursue my _"Master's in Computer Science."_ Through these experiences, I've had the opportunity to create memorable projects that are not only enjoyable to use but are written in code that's maintainable and easy to understand. My goal is to always build products that provide pixel-perfect, performant experiences.

Through my studies, I've gained a solid understanding of computer science and web development concepts, and have dedicated a lot of my free time to apply these concepts to real-world scenarios and applications. Apart from developing cool applications, I’m a hobbyist photographer on unsplash with over _"1M+ views"_ and _"10K+ downloads"_. I also like to cook.
