I’m Avi, who enjoys developing software, whether that be websites, applications, or anything in between.

After my undergrad college degree in _"Computer Science and Engineering"_, to further my knowledge I decided to pursue my _"Master's in Computer Science."_ Through these experiences, I've had the opportunity to create memorable projects that are not only enjoyable to use but are written in code that's maintainable and easy to understand.

I am currently working as a Full-Stack Developer at [LegrandAV](https://www.legrandav.com/). My goal is to always build products that provide pixel-perfect performant experiences.

Through my studies and work experience, I've gained a solid understanding of computer science and web development in the modern industry. I have dedicated a lot of my free time to learn and work on new personal projects. Apart from developing cool applications, I’m a hobbyist photographer on unsplash with over _"1M+ views"_ and _"10K+ downloads"_. I also like to cook.
