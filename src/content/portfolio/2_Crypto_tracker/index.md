A simple react cryptocurrency price tracking app. The users can search for the currencies and get back the latest information (such as market cap, current price, total volume, price change percentage and more.) on their search. This app uses the CoinGecko's cryptocurrency API to get the latest cryptocurrency data. Also, the users can refresh to get this very second's information.
