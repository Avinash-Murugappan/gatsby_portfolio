A python django app (eBay-like) e-commerce auction site that will allow users to post auction listings, place bids on listings, comment on those listings and add listings to a "watchlist". The users can view the active listings through categories as well. The user will be able to post, comment and add the listing to their watchlist only if they are logged in to their account.
